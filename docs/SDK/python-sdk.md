# Python SDK Reference

> **💡 Reminder:** If you are using a Reachy Mini Wireless and running the script on your computer, in the following examples you need to replace `ReachyMini()` by `ReachyMini(localhost_only=False)`.

## Movement

### Basic Control (`goto_target`)
Smooth interpolation between points. You can control `head`, `antennas`, and `body_yaw`.

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose
import numpy as np

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Move everything at once
    mini.goto_target(
        head=create_head_pose(z=10, mm=True),    # Up 10mm
        antennas=np.deg2rad([45, 45]),           # Antennas out
        body_yaw=np.deg2rad(30),                 # Turn body
        duration=2.0,                            # Take 2 seconds
        method="minjerk"                         # Smooth acceleration
    )
```

**Interpolation methods:** `linear`, `minjerk` (default), `ease`, `cartoon`.

### Instant Control (`set_target`)
Bypasses interpolation. Use this for high-frequency control (e.g., following a joystick or generated trajectory).

## Sensors & Media

### Camera 📷

Get camera frames from the real robot (Picamera2 or OpenCV) or from simulation (Mujoco rendering). Frames are streamed via ZMQ.

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    frame = mini.media.get_frame()
```
The returned frame is a numpy array with shape `(height, width, 3)` and data type `uint8`.


### Audio 🎙️ 🔊

Audio inputs (microphones) and outputs (speaker) is handled as follows:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from scipy.signal import resample
import time

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Initialization - After this point, both audio devices (input/output) will be seen as busy by other applications!
    mini.media.start_recording()
    mini.media.start_playing()

    # Record
    samples = mini.media.get_audio_sample()

    # Resample (if needed)
    samples = resample(samples, mini.media.get_output_audio_samplerate()*len(samples)/mini.media.get_input_audio_samplerate())

    # Play
    mini.media.push_audio_sample(samples)
    time.sleep(len(samples) / mini.media.get_output_audio_samplerate())

    # Release audio devices (input/output)
    mini.media.stop_recording()
    mini.media.stop_playing()
```

**Audio data format:**
- `get_audio_sample()` returns a numpy array with shape `(samples, 2)` and data type `float32`, sampled at 16kHz.
- `push_audio_sample()` expects a numpy array with shape `(samples, 1 or 2)` and data type `float32`, sampled at 16kHz.

In both cases, the channels and samplerate information can be reliably retrieved with `get_input/output_audio_samplerate()` and `get_input/output_channels()`.

> **⚠️ Note:** `push_audio_sample()` is non-blocking, meaning it returns immediately while audio plays in the background. If you need to wait for playback completion, calculate the duration based on sample length and sample rate.

## Recording Moves
You can record a motion by moving the robot (compliant mode) or sending commands, and save it for later replay.

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
with ReachyMini() as mini:
    mini.start_recording()
    # ... robot moves ...
    recorded_data = mini.stop_recording()
```
